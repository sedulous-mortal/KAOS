# KAOS
Language Learning in Java (awkward and slow)

So, once upon a time I had a dream that I would make a fun chatterbot companion for kids that engages with them regarding their personal preferences and personality. It would do things like learn their favorite real (and mythical/imaginary) creatures and what sounds those beings make, and through typing to the bot, the child would find a friend to share experiences and personal beliefs with - a sounding board for all the creative crazy ideas the child had. 

My code is very messy and not currently working as needed, but I continue to believe that in SOME language (probably not Java)  at SOME point (maybe by next year), the KAOS program will be at least as exciting for the user, if not as extensive, as I once imagined.

My current challenge (as explained in many of the comments in my code) is to get the KAOS bot to create and store new variable values as they are input by the user (e.g. "Dragon" would be paired with "roar!").

If you stumble upon my code and have any questions for me, please feel free to email me at alisonnicolestuart@gmail.com.
